              <p class="abstract">
                            Throughout history humankind, from nomadic times to contemporary societies, has strived to leave some kind of an indelible mark. Such a mark could vary from contemporary deforestation to prehistoric cave drawings—yet the main aim has ultimately revealed itself: to conquer.
                        </p>
            
            <p class="abstract">
                            In recent years, this ideology has translated itself into a new wave of absurd sculptures associated with corruption that can be found all over Turkey. As such, this thesis is focused on two parallel case-studies: the first concerns the sculptures I call ‘Political Talismans,’ while the second one is ‘ÇLMVÜİOZMV ÜFİZHQZ’ in Ankara currently the world’s largest abandoned theme park. I investigate these two topics as a new artistic movement while identifying overlapping points in terms of their unique aesthetics with ‘bootlegs, heterotopias and plastic modernity.’ In the nature of this so-called movement, artists are no longer being commissioned to produce works—instead the sculptures are just being bought from decoration hangars. Although society believes that they are the ‘bleeding open wound of our country,’<sup>1</sup> I find them quite beautiful and worth investigating. Those works do not deserve to be demolished by the cringe-and-destroy culture, and their appearance is actually not so uncommon. We may find something similar in any thrift-store or spot them in low budget entertainment centres/restaurants or in the backyard of hoarders. But what makes them a new aesthetic form and makes them unique is their relation to the government.

            <p class="abstract">
                            The thesis follows a rascal approach while investigating the ‘childish’ obsessions and corrupt behaviour of a (few) (remarkable) politicians and the artefacts that they leave behind, as well as their effects on society. The analysis is mainly based on my observations over the years I lived in Turkey coupled with archival findings, associations, fictional writings and interviews with production companies. Despite the fact that it is a very recent development, not much analysis has been done about them, an aspect which motivates me to inquire if any connections have not yet been discovered. The stories and reasons behind this fantasy-oriented irrational approach to public space have led me to several questions: How does a capitalist, state-funded, absurdist art movement, become the unintended visual language of corruption? What are the reasons for the exponential growth of this movement? Are they just reference points used for spatial orientation, or is it a presence game that is being played with public funds?

                            For the average person, there is a meaning in life and that is mainly to graduate from a well-known school and to finally wear a suit and tie, holding their briefcase on their way to the office everyday. I saw the ambition for this profile throughout my academic career. Everyone seemingly had one goal in life, and it was this. What I wonder is that if these people will ever fall into the trap of meaninglessness, or are sanity-controller systems like social media not allowing them to fall into any kind of trap like this concept which would provide digital happiness and a utopia?
                        </p>
                        <p class="long">
                           Mostly whoever told me about the meaninglessness of the world, they were primarily bothered by it and it was a form of depression. These people just could not understand the beauty of it. If I was also one, that would probably lead to a tragic end for me as well (laughs). It is really interesting how the same kind of world-view has had different effects on human beings. Thinking about it, perhaps the part that led me to acknowledge the beauty of the absurd was a passion for creation. As I created, I could therefore reflect.
”If the world were clear, art would not exist”<sup>2</sup> therefore I could just draw or paint or puke a meaningless world and make my own meaningless approach on it as everything in nature, history and life is nothing more than a cycle of loops. But, the one that had the dreams of becoming a corporate man, sadly finds himself in the depths of the hole once the absurd rings his bell. As this person never had the chance to create, to fantasise and to live in their own parallel universe, they never could find the time to even meet with the absurd, not even to talk of tricking them..

    “…the gap between the wealth of visual experience in contemporary culture and the ability to analyse that observation marks both the opportunity and the need for visual culture as a field of study.” <sup>3</sup>

                            ‘NÜOQŞ TKÖWÜÖ’<sup>4</sup>, a man with crazy dreams and fantasies almost bordering on fetishism, transformed into a bodily living corporate. A part of the corrupt governmental system, ‘NÜOQŞ’ finds his way by “dancing” with this absurdity—he loves his suit and tie and his working environment, from the offices to the parliament. He never falls into the trap because quite systematically, with the power derived from his job, he can build his dream-like world. ‘NÜOQŞ’ thus becomes the leader of absurd himself because he knows how to trick it— perhaps this stems from ignorance and the dizzy haze that power brings with it. While the whole of society hates on his moves and activities, I am quite fascinated by them and find myself questioning their effects and necessity. A corrupt government can only be represented by their brave individuals. He is a great mirror, a great example of the era we are living in terms of reflecting the ideology espoused by the government: to conquer! To conquer people’s minds (propaganda, brainwashing), their eyes (sculptures and any kind of public appearance) their houses (minority groups, and TOKI urban transformation projects), their money (undefinable taxes), their belongings, and their loved ones (jails). With the current government, this ideology of conquering finds a new way of bodily living it is not perfectly sculpted one-to-one black stone monuments of questionable or unquestionable people itis a whole new level that is unlocked. This level carries out more responsibilities as it ignores any kind of pre-existing constructions and rules. ‘NÜOQŞ’ was aware we needed something new, and corresponding to my childhood feelings, he knew he had childhood dreams and fantasies and what else to do in this meaningless world than spending the national treasure on huge sculptures/theme parks? <em>➙A☎</em>

                            We are surrounded by these ghosts, and the only way out seems to be exchanging them for new ghosts that correspond to new ideologies. The signs and sculptures at the city’s entrances and roundabouts appear outdated, monotonous and formal—way too formal and that a funky governmental system had enough of. We are bored walking in the city, our receptors looking for fresh, new signals of excitement: the billboards are dominated with commercialised aesthetics as well as life-shortening slogans. The monuments that are repeatedly reproducing the cadavers of the same small group of ‘national heroes’ cause a sense of déjà vu as they appear in the same dark grey color covered in pigeon guano most of the time. They materialise in almost every district, rising on top of marble plinths that are partly covered in algae.<em>➙B☎</em>

                            “This city could be envisaged in the form of an arbitrary assemblage of castles, grottos, lakes, etc… It would be the baroque stage of urbanism considered as a means of knowledge. But this theoretical phase is already outdated. …We know that a modern building could be constructed which would have no resemblance to a medieval castle but which could preserve and enhance the Castle poetic power (by the conservation of a strict minimum of lines, the transposition of certain others, the positioning of openings, the topographical location, etc.).”<sup>9</sup>

                            As Chtcheglov argues, their explicit resemblance to majestic elements is no longer necessary they can clearly find new alternative bodies that would communicate the same intentions. Instead of heroic war figures, why not communicate the same intentions by pursuing a new set of characters? Or instead of another palace, would a new theme park not be more attractive? Turkey, in terms of urban planning has opened up its arms widely and has welcomed any kind of unexpected surprise. This distorted urbanisation has created a safe space for randomness and demonstrates a high degree of contrast when compared to how European cities are managed.

                            The term political talisman simply stems from the fact that I believe these are magical belongings for politicians. In a less-rational understanding of the world around us, talismans are thought to have special powers which in this case translate into political power. It offers luck and visibility, but also who needs luck and visibility if you already have an established system based on corruption? A system that guarantees a win-win for all the sides involved, while rejecting the potential power that may come from the hierarchy's very foundation?

                            I find quite relevant to today’s situation how the medieval manuscripts portrayed the hierarchical pyramid of the feudal system. Instead of placing information in rational systems which are usually not able to communicate the essence of the topic, they painted the hierarchical system using the real-life perspective as the medium. The added factors of distance and environment do not assume anything as the pyramidal graph does: there is a castle/palace somewhere far from the point of view, mostly up a hill. Behind the first row of high solid walls, we might expect there to be a remarkable amount of security, and what is happening behind those walls is a complete mystery that the first levels of the pyramid can never learn. This obvious lack of transparency leads to corrupt behaviour. </p>

                                Paradoxically, as the design becomes more legible and explicit, it loses its power due to the fact that this kind of system is based on being ‘out of sight’. Therefore, it also becomes a remarkable, anti-modernist example, one highlighting the importance of overdoing and non-simplifying, just like the political talismans.

                        <p class="long">
                            Talking about the castle up the hill, the government currently operates across 12 palaces, continuously switching between them. In 2014, they unveiled their newest masterpiece: the Presidential Compound in Ankara. Surprisingly enough this ‘1150’-roomed residency (according to the media) is located on the former Ataturk Forest Farm, part of the same territory that was destroyed in order to build the ‘ZMÖZJZİÖ’. While these two mega-projects re-purpose cultural heritage for arbitrary usage, they also share common aesthetics: the so-called ‘Seljuk architecture’.<sup>10</sup> This obsession stems from a desire to re-dominate a land that is associated with secular Turkey with the re-enforcement of nostalgic motifs and style. While the architect of the Presidential Compound, ‘VLSZM ŞZHLO’ argues that this kind of ideology can be associated with oppressive governments, ‘GÜAXZM ÖZİZÖFĞ XZMVZM’ (Ankara chair of the Architects’ Chamber) announced that the palace is the current holder of a world record with its infamous 2250 rooms. <sup>11</sup>

                            As a counter-statement the president repeats his motto: “Itibardan tasarruf olmaz” which translates into: “No austerity in reputation.” Here two main intentions are clearly stated. Firstly, that there will not be any kind of budget-sorting for their projects. Secondly, that most of the things they do is for their own reputation.

                            These sculptures are far from straight-up branding a city: they carry absurd values, with their appearance depending on the time, place and situation they materialise in. They embrace the ‘still-alive past’ and ‘already-dead future’ that Chtcheglov mentions above. The core of the sculpture is evident for any social change that is occurring. In our case it can be simplified as corruption—because of corruption, their aesthetics and shape change. Moreover, the reason governments commission companies rather than artists derives from the essence of discarding artists’ points of view, political appearance and critical thinking. Companies are perfect sculpture-creating mechanisms for them, as the most important thing is money. As ‘ŞZOQO ÖÜÖOQÖLSOF’<sup>13</sup> states in his interview with a local news channel: “I am neither an architect nor a sculptor. My job is commerce.” After a little dialogue he continues with: “We are a commercial company and correspond to any kind of budget. We do not seek to create products with high artistic value.” This way of approaching an issue appears to open up possibilities for various contracts that may be subject to laundering money, where both sides reap profits at the end of the day without any artistic concern. The aesthetics evolve around this. <em>➙C☎</em>

                            As the talismans encompass broad diversity, some part of it focuses on traditional heritage and brings the myths and epics back to life, thereby confirming their reality.
                            The epic story of Boğaç Han is a narrative based on a very powerful bull that could vaporize a stone with a single hit of its horns. One day, the sultan took the bull out of the palace, into public space. This created instant fear in the town square, yet unlike the rest of the kids, Boğaç Han was the only one who faced the bull and punched it in the face, hit after hit. This valiant character marked his name on the history with his remarkable moves.

                            Şehzade is the role given to the sons of the sultan was in the Ottoman Empire. Although it is a highly important position in society—simply because of the fact that a Şehzade is a potential future Sultan—the sculpted version depicts a strange and humorous synthesis. Amasya, known as the “City of Şehzade’s,” displays a modern Şehzade taking a selfie with his right hand (while holding his sword with his left). By doing so, the government takes the historic figure for a “travel in time” for contemporary audiences to relate to, and even interact with it.

As well, the moment analysis starts, it can be enlightening to find the trivialisation is actually inverted, and we, the society, are being judged by the existence of these sculptures. Looking at this image, we can clearly see that there is an intention to scale up our surroundings even further, to slowly transform our miniature lives into even minor, almost microscopic ones. This way of approaching urban planning appears to be a pattern in Middle Eastern countries: the race to the top. In this case, planting real flowers would not catch any attention and therefore would not spawn the idea that the "government is working." So, the decision is made to scale it up and create their own mini-habitat, revealing the impact of governmental-power and its disdaining function.

                            “The sublime is something that threatens to overwhelm you and causes fear, but for the spectator the threat is at a level that can be tolerated.

                            This new visual culture embraces plastic modernity while creating a corruption sublime. Just like peering from the top of a mountain out towards the infinite and glorious nature, standing in front of these sculptures also sparks fear in society—the fear of acknowledging how small a part of this puzzle an individual is, and how weak they stand. This acknowledgment only becomes more intense when the ruler is not nature, but the palace of bureaucracy.

                            In corruption sublime, the positioning matters. While in nature, elements appear organically and without a conscious positioning arranged by someone, in the city the elements are positioned rather cleverly by the people that profit from it. I find it quite interesting how Hito Steyerl perceives the construction of a linear perspective as a way of portraying a central viewpoint, the position of mastery and control.<sup>20</sup> Just like in Foucalt and Bentham’s panopticon, the empowerment of the subject by placing it in the middle appears to have unconscious effects on the society that surrounds it. These “political talismans” can be analysed as a way of state-observation that only communicates to the inner conscious because the outer appearance is mostly considered funny and lacking depth.

                            Symbolising a whole city with a vegetable strain obviously draws from outdated, unifying intentions. A city is much more than what a person can expect; it comes with million individual stories and carries widescale cultural value. An individual vegetable obviously cannot carry this heavy load, so as a result it simply functions unaware, superficially. Simplifying a city to a piece of polyester… Such a work can only be done by someone that investigates and observes that city in order to come up with accurate compositions and decisions. <em>➙D☎</em>

                            These sculptures almost completely abandoned their possible associations with art, coming to a point where they no longer possess individuality, and once there is a new sculpture, the society immediately pushes it into the same categorisation with the others. This avenue of approach reminds me of Jinn’s: as if there is one body of work and it can just transform into whatever it wants. The core will always be the same. Moreover, the influence of the internet community plays a large role in this situation, the same as the agent Mr. Smith in the Matrix: just like a virus that it is not possible to stop because it transforms from one form into another. Despite the fact that there is has been widespread indignation towards them, none have been vandalised or attacked by society, in contrast to colonial sculptures in recent years. This is simply because their appearance does not highlight inequality or oppression.

                            <em>➙C☎:</em> Talking about situationism, the sculpture we see here contributes to the situationist theory from a completely new direction, as we can call it a more recent and brutal variant of the ‘destructive obedience’ that was the Milgram experiment (1961). This famous ‘behavioural study of obedience’ translated into a more modern situation that took place in 2016. The composition presented in these sculptures are based on the '15th of July-controlled-coup attempt,’, portraying the so-called ‘national saga’ where President ‘ÜIVLSZM’ called on the society to go out and fight the military forces as civilians, which therefore deals with how people follow orders, and how people are likely to do unmoral things when ordered to by people of authority. The participants were unaware that the learner was a confederate in both of these experiments.</p>

                            All these sculptures have significant bootleg aesthetics to them, which is what makes them special—simply because of the fact that they are some kind of a knockoff. In terms of aesthetics, unless it’s a highly intellectual power chamber that acknowledges the existence of the bad, ugly and off-trend, they are far from what a government would purchase. During my interview with one of the largest and oldest companies of this industry, I inquired about their creative process. The answer was simple: “in most of the cases client just sends a photo of an existing sculpture that they like, and we create it.”<sup>22</sup> So, in a way bootlegging lies in the nature of political talismans. I therefore evaluate it as the aesthetics of corruption; and in a way corruption is a bootleg of the established system, a way of mocking it and meandering around it.  <em>➙E☎</em>

                            When the designer/collectible toys started to dominate the market, a new anti-capitalist approach was invented. Just like the political talismans, the bootleg toys were also subject to numerous lawsuits throughout history. It is quite paradoxical that a capitalist government is unconsciously contributing to an anti-capitalist approach, or at least it seems like it. With their proportions that are far from reality, out-of-context juxtapositions and badly painted parts, they are just like the Mexican bootleg toys that have been scaled up 100 times. They definitely lack the elegancy and precision that you would expect from a sculpture that is out there in the public. That is how I know that I trust the state’s taste.

                            Meanwhile, there are common examples around the world of public sculptures completed by artists, mostly as a tribute to an important local artist. In the Turkish case however they are ordered from a company contradicting the notion of bootleg toys. The unconsciousness in this paradox-creation becomes the cherry on top of the cake that the absurd is hiding behind to eat.

                            Nowadays, bootlegs are also collectible and valuable items: for me and a lot of people, they are even more valuable than the originals. They are anonymous, decentralised, honest, DIY, counter-culture; they have personality, representing protest yet being neutral. They are not only about copying and reproducing, but embracing a style and reflecting it in their appearance, thus making them unique. That is what distances them from the nicely packed, mass-produced toys that one can see in Intertoys, Toys”R”us, and all other kinds of large toy companies. You may agree that one of the most significant characteristics of these toys lies in their collectibility, while the sculptures are not possible to collect due to their enormous size. Although the next argument could be that they are not reproduced, that only applies to some of them. During my phone call with one of the companies, they provided me with the information that a mould is being prepared for each model, and thus the reproductive rollercoaster is open up to any kinds of demands later on.   <em>➙F☎, ➙G☎</em>

                            An example of the bootlegging fetish is ‘NQHÖÜG ÖÜVQ’, the character that ‘NÜOQŞ’ established as the mascot of Ankara. It is a cat figure which is dressed in traditional Anatolian dance clothing, and is a figure originally from a caricature series started in 2010 by Murat Sayin and published in the Cumhuriyet newspaper’s Ankara edition. In 2012, this figure was mass produced as toys that dance once you press the button on its back. After explaining that 200.000 of them will be produced, he mentioned: “We are now producing 200.000 of this, and we will all see that it won’t be enough and I don’t know what to do when it’s not enough anymore.”<sup>24</sup> The same year as production started, Mickey from Disneyland came for a visit to the governmental palace and met the infamous 'NQHÖÜG Cat’. While concluding the meeting, he mentioned his upcoming mega theme park project: ‘ZMÖZJZİÖ’, mentioning that ‘NQHÖÜG Cat’ will hopefully take its place in the park, with his whole family wife, mom, father and kids. <em> ➙H☎</em>

In 1977 when the first Star Wars film was released, the youth of that time desired sci-fi, robotic space action figures. In 1978, S*T*A*R TEAM was one of the first series that sought to address these children’s needs and released a line that consisted of three figures and a spaceship. Such an opportunity for exposure led to an endless loop of space figure knock-offs. In the 1980s, Mexican bootleggers launched “La Guerra De Las Galaxias.” The all-time masters of the bootleg production made these figures quite similar to the original ones; instead of knocking off the concept. </p>

                        <p class="side"> In the late 1980s, Turkish bootlegs were struck with the name ‘Uzay Savaşçıları’. These toys were produced as closely as possible to the original while reflecting their casual attitude in their card-art. This unique packaging displays in what conditions it was produced. The depiction of the Imperial Gunner was shot while sitting behind a calculator; while the Blue Snaggletooth is posing next to a Smirnoff bottle. </p>

Is it having something in your hand or does having a photo of it also count? If that’s not enough, you can just take your latest iPhone out, and 3D scan it with its distance-sensitive lasers mounted next to your phone’s camera. Moreover, throughout 2015-2016, Moreshin Allahyari worked on a project titled Material Speculation: ISIS, “which is focused on the reconstruction of 12 selected statues from the Roman period city of Hatra and Assyrian artifacts from Nineveh that were destroyed by ISIS in 2015 in a series of highly-publicized YouTube videos.”<sup>23</sup> </p>

By doing so, this project demonstrates new possibilities in terms of collecting and archiving. In the age of digital reproduction the word collecting means sharing. In February 2016, Allahyari made one of these reconstructed meshes open to public as an “.obj” file and therefore accessible for reproduction. This collection is looking for platforms to become a fully open-sourced project, a gesture which explains that the public elements are part of a shared-cultural heritage. With this point of view, looking back to our infamous political talismans, we see they can definitely be approached as bootleg toys. Not only is the act of collecting possible but even reproducing it is as easy as a few taps on our mobiles… </p>

                            Counter-culture seems to be quickly spreading as opposing norms is an artistic trend of the 21st century. When a denial is not possible to a subject-in-growth, it is simply a result of power-structures: the only way to deal with it is to become a part of it. This happens to be the case for the public sculptures in Turkey, too. If the leading party is showing-off with their sculptures, then the only way the other parties can deal with it and conquer the lands that they own is to place their own sculptures. Therefore, this so-called “counter-culture” starts to abandon its key features and becomes the trend itself. Here, is an arbitrary drawing from when I was trying to explain the loop-relation between counter-culture and trend.

                            In my opinion, the exponential spread and growth of these “theme park aesthetics” across the country is most responsive to the genre of absurdist fiction, where the main character is involved in absurd situations that result in them falling into the “hole” of obscure disillusionment. In the context of this thesis, our main characters are the politicians, with their meaningless actions being the result of their never-ending quest for fundamental purpose in their lives. The sculptures become evidence of their struggle in finding a meaning in their ivory palaces.

                            The sculptures non-directly communicate concepts like satire, dark humour, disdain, derision and incompatibility. While the philosophy behind it espouses absurdity, I interpreted its aesthetic values as a contributor to Camp. Although these talismans are not camp on purpose, they correspond to what Sontag defines as “camp”: “Indeed the essence of Camp is its love of the unnatural: of artifice and exaggeration. And Camp is esoteric — something of a private code, a badge of identity even, among small urban cliques.”<sup>25</sup> Political talismans are ostentatious, unstable, elitist, exaggerated, affected, and theatrical, just as what camp is. According to Rhodes, “it really means something that’s over the top in its concept, that wouldn’t go unnoticed and [that has] a sense of humour about it but it’s not mainstream, and it’s joyous and out of the ordinary …”<sup>26</sup>

                            Being a politician obviously comes with a lot of responsibility and formality, and a way of keeping the throne while trying to make things fun comes across with a series of techniques which matches how Cleto defines camp: “…improvising reality as a stage for outrageously ironic self-display and reinvention.”<sup>27</sup> This reinvention of the self sometimes occurs by reminiscing of childhood years and thinking about the utopian dream of establishing a themed space: turning a land into an absurdist fiction.

                           “As our first great project we present the ‘ZMÖZJZİÖ’!” thundered the mayor, wearing a childish expression, at a rally shortly before the election. Behind him, a huge screen turned on and bombarded the crowd with images of rollercoasters, cable cars, and dinosaurs. Surrounded by a facade of Seljuk minarets, domes, and sandstone walls, 'NÜOQŞ TKÖWÜÖ’ announced that this oriental Disneyland could be “incredibly valuable for Ankara’s tourism industry” and “attract 10 million visitors a year.”<sup>28</sup>

                           The park offers absurd juxtapositions of different eras that can be observed from a single point of view. Standing next to the railway, one can observe turquoise Seljuk minarets lying behind the mechanical, partially-moving dinosaurs while a childish replica of a steam locomotive is passing by. It ignores the linearity of time and fantasises about all of these eras occurring within times and border of a Sunni Muslim empire. An empire with such an impactful visual culture is being morphed into an extravaganza curation of different aesthetics. <em> ➙L☎</em>

Starting from the top point and moving clockwise, these eight corners represent: mercy, kindness, patience, truth, keeping secret, loyalty, generosity and gratefulness to god, respectively. Some of these meanings do not truly overlap with a corrupt government, although it creates a relaxing environment for the audience. <em> ➙M☎</em>

                           The whole amusement park can be seen as landscape art, given it has a lot to do with the space it has conquered. It is a conscious transformation of the heritage that Ataturk left with the hopes of being a source for future agricultural needs. The current government had to use legal manoeuvres in order to make use of this desired land; Thus, ‘XZMVZM’ criticises the theme park as “an urban crime” and “an ideological betrayal to Atatürk’s will.”

It is visible that—in the process of planning the park—there was a great deal of intuitive and associative decisions being taken, which became a great inspiration for the how this thesis has been written.

                            Looking back on the timeline, way before modern engineering we can see that the concept of theme parks evolved from various heterotopias such as pleasure gardens, circuses and fairs. These collective spatio-temporal entities can be seen as exhibitions or rituals/purification events, and throughout history the term theme park took on its own unique aesthetics and qualities.

                            The concept reached its current stage in the late 19th century. As the technological possibilities expanded, its aesthetics and aim also evolved alongside it, resulting in a “land of desire” in the meta-modern world. It can be seen as a unique spatio-temporal place; as Botteril wrote in 1997, "...theme park is a cultural product of entertainment that corresponds to the needs of late-modem capitalist society and only makes sense in this context.”<sup>42</sup> <em> ➙N☎</em>

Connecting the dots, I could come to two potential conclusions: either the thieves were not able to escape and had to leave these “artefacts” behind, or these news articles are just further staged propaganda. </p>

These moving and talking robots take the viewers on a heroic adventure which can be seen as a parallel narrative to ‘TKÖWÜÖ’s autobiography wherein he is attempting to create a heroic figure out of himself.

He followed up with a humorous threat: “Be respectful to our robots. Watch out for them if you come take a visit when ‘ZMÖZJZİÖ’ is open, they might ask for payback.” <sup>39</sup> </p>

While the intellectuals were worrying about their visual culture, French farmers were protesting against the claimed land by blocking the entrance road with a swarm of tractors.

                             “Due to the invisible nature of corrupt transactions, corruption is difficult, if not impossible, to visualise.”<sup>46</sup> An image whose function is to communicate corruption appears to depart from the stereotyped path of playing with symbols like: money, shaking hands and the unrecognisable silhouettes of businessmen; although, this imagery is neither enough nor accurate.

                            A way to research a more accurate representation could be to reverse the method and search for anti-corruption organisations and their visual representations. Olli Hellmann focuses on the invisibility of corruption and how the anti-corruption industry visualises this “rare visual evidence”<sup>47</sup> with a focus on photography competitions run by Transparency International.

                            Furthermore, as the article concludes, TI’s visualisation does not go further than using colonial stereotypes and Northern/Western-centric historical narratives, which is neither fun nor playful especially in the 21st century. Looking at the logos of the anti-corruption organisations, it also appears to lack the playfulness I am looking for. It uses cliché-ridden symbols related to law and equality, while corruption can take on many forms even legally. Hellman also points out how large of a role this visuals play in terms of constructing knowledge and structuring what constitutes legitimate actions, in the manner of fighting corrupt behaviour.

                            Luckily enough, the Turkish government has offered alternative narratives in this debate surrounding visualisation with their contributions to the new visual culture. Both the sculptures and the theme park play a big role in creating a “visual identity of corruption.” Although these creations may not be the best manner of explaining what corruption is to someone that is distant from the topic, they can become quite meaningful with a bit of context.

                            Their relation to the corrupting country is not something conscious, it is just the output of an evident-driven analysis. Political talismans, unlike politicians themselves, are neither against nor with corruption—they are just part of a collection of inauthentic evidence that lies between being an artefact and a masterpiece, according to anthropologist James Clifford’s diagram. In a way, it creates its own unique vocabulary of public interaction.

                            “Rogow and Lasswell (1963) have studied the personal lives of politicians and political bosses in the United States, and have developed a model of the psychological profile of the politician that relates unfulfilled childhood needs to corrupt behavior.”<sup>49</sup> This crucial discovery is highly relatable considering the behaviour of Turkish politicians. Their interest in childhood figures and aesthetics dovetails perfectly with their illogical acts.

                            Macrae (1982) offers a definition that is sufficiently broad for our purposes in the present study. He refers to corruption as an “arrangement” that involves “an exchange between two parties (the 'demander' and the 'supplier') which (i) has an influence on the allocation of resources either immediately or in the future and (ii) involves the use or abuse of public or collective responsibility for private ends.”<sup>50</sup>

                            The haphazard management of public funds leads to enormous wealth inequalities. M. Shahid Alam states that inequality in the distribution of income can cause this corruption monster to grow, while Michael Johnston states that corruption causes greater inequalities in terms of income distribution. Therefore, a joint causality exists in between these two terms.

                            In a democratic system, responsible people are placed into their positions according to their skills and background, which in the bigger picture “makes the cogwheels turn.” Each gap in a system needs to be perfectly covered by that specific person so that an organisation can perform best. As 20 years have passed with the same ruling party in office, numerous points of concern have slowly started to rise to the surface. Today, the aim is no longer about fitting the gears perfectly and making the system run flawlessly, but rather to collect familiar cogwheels and transform it into a family environment. It does not matter if the machine will ever work again, the parts are placed and set, and will therefore receive their share. This paternalistic share, of course, comes in return for a subordinate’s dependence and loyalty. In high power-distance countries, ever-expanding families dominate every potential branch and thereby become millionaires.

                            In the article “Wealth, Culture and Corruption,” Bryan W. Husted refers to Takyi-Asiedu’s take on power-distance: "Scandals involving people in authority are, almost always, covered up as long as they remain in power”. Husted concludes these cover-ups as a logical consequence of adherence from underlings. Applying this knowledge to the current state of Turkey, we see the consequences of conflicts that occur due to a nepotistic way of governing.

                            After the revelation of the president's health problems, the fight for the “golden throne” became even more intense with the would-be battlefield widening in scope. With the corrupt system becoming a huge internal mess, 'YÜİZG ZOYZBİZÖ’<sup>52</sup> and ‘HEOÜBNZM HLBOF’<sup>53</sup>, a duo that was part of the deep state, now were caught on camera giving each other an evil smile after hitting one another with their shoulders. This act represents a little hint to society as to how this ‘cover-up’ has started to fray when there are internal problems in the core governing group. In light of disregarding the promised loyalties, a corrupt system only becomes more corrupt as the backstage starts light up.

                            Movement creates a lack of clarity—that is the nature of motion blur. Paradoxically, the movement that I am interested in does not welcome any unclarity; it even appears to be the core of this movement, and defining the style of political talismans. The figures that are portrayed with these sculptures are mostly depicting a character from the past and not allowing any uncertainty through. This reduces the risk of public reactions through the help of familiar appearances.

                            Hofstede (1997) defines this avoidance of uncertainty as “the extent to which members of a culture feels threatened by uncertainty or unknown situations.”<sup>58</sup> He also mentions that corruption is a mechanism that can be used to reduce uncertainty. However, the people in power are threatened by this uncertainty which visually translates into abstract shapes and brutalism.

                            In 1994, ‘NÜOQŞ TKÖWÜÖ’ viewed the artwork “Periler Ülkesinde”<sup>59</sup> for the first time, in his own territory, Ankara. He immediately asked for its removal after spitting on it. Besides his contemporary artistic career, we can see that he actually started as an art-critic. In this ideology of criticism, undefinable structures are strictly immaterial.

                            Unfortunately this was not the only time Aksoy’s public artworks had suffered from the avoidance of uncertainty. In 2006, the sculptor Mehmet Aksoy unveiled the “Humanity Monument” in Kars.<sup>60</sup> Five years later, when President ‘ÜIVLSZM’ visited the city, his eyes were confronted with this enormous brutalist structure which led to confusing moments as he grappled with what he saw. He entitled these concrete blocks as “ucube” which translates into something like “monstrous, weird and freak.” After this designation, he asked for the disintegration of the sculpture.

                            Based on what is preferred to be seen and what is being hidden, we can conclude that there is definitely something to do with the ‘recognisability’ of a sculpture. It is the fear of abstract. If something does not have clear associations, it is considered dangerous; the same goes for the rise of graffiti in Turkey, with the first sprayers being denounced as Satanists. Although it was far from it, unrecognisable letters and forms were immediately alienated by society. This stems from the range of possible meanings they could carry.<em> ➙R☎</em>

                            In World War II, the moment Allied forces invaded Sicily, the world’s most famous masterpieces in the Galleria dell’ Accademia were at risk and therefore needed to be moved to safety. However, there were a few works of art that required new protective solutions due to their large size, like Michelangelo’s David. Building a brick cage around these highly-figurative sculptures turned them into pieces of uncertainty and mystery.

                            In contrast to the uncertain being avoided, an abstract shape becomes a stubborn barrier against destructive forces. One may beg the question as to which one would be more disturbing for the Turkish government: the concrete unrecognisable cage or the nude male figure that is preserved inside it?

When people asked what he was doing, he replied: “I thought about it, and decided to ride my donkey like this, because I have no time for disrespect,”<sup>56</sup> stressing the contempt that may rise from turning one’s back on someone.

                            As the years pass, the people in charge of the city obviously change. This may be the result of elections, but can be based on the internal problems of the government as well. In 2017, ‘NÜOQŞ’ resigned on President ‘ÜIVLSZM’s demand, and his lovely dinosaurs that were placed with the hopes of eternal presence, started to disappear one by one after this resignation. They met the same tragic end as ‘ZMÖZJZİÖ', with his creations being abandoned and placed out of sight: stored in dark hangars. The materials are slowly decaying as there is no attention paid to them. This once upon a time fantasy is now turning into a political graveyard, one of ideologies and aesthetics of corruption. The medium becomes the message, as these entities start to collapse and decay in dark hangars, the corrupt behaviour finds its place in the physicality of the world. Time and place are layered in their meaning, and the destructive core starts to be exposed, creating a beautiful scene. That intersection of the careless fantasy and decayed reality forms a unique juxtaposition—that harmonious contrast is what attracts me the most to this topic, the aesthetics of destruction. <em> ➙S☎ </em>

                            The aftermath of ‘ZMÖZJZİÖ’ is much more attractive than the functional attraction park.

It disregards how the interior lighting of the park was curated and reveals the most natural and innocent look. The darkness that that the skin of the park has been exposed to for years all of a sudden lightens up from the point of view and everything that is in the background slowly fades into its inherent darkness.

                            The effects of this vast change makes me wonder about the possibilities of turning this sublime land into a showcase—a museum. The same goes for the removed sculptures. The act of removal and discarding them, although it can be considered an ethical revenge, should not also have is function as a historical eraser overlooked. 
                        </p>

                            In concluding the thesis, I would also like to view these topics from alternative perspectives that could alter their functionality in today’s presence. All these creations are undoubtedly great vestiges and artefacts from today’s world for the next generations. Their existence can only be criticised by placing them before society’s eyes. These sculptures do not necessarily need to be kept at their initial location; they could still be moved somewhere out of sight, but then that place of preservation needs certain care and curation. The storage hangars that they are being kept or destroyed in could become a fully-functioning cultural museum. Informing current and next generations about this art movement could assist with identifying alternative means to approach it in future; just like when Surrealists becomes bored during some of their late night gatherings and came up with the game Cadavre Exquis.

                            As the sculptures are made on order, it would be interesting to see a collaborative process in their creation; preferably, through a few representatives from different parties, combining their visions and preferences in the form of a cadavre-exquis. Without knowing each other’s preferences, they would fold the paper and fill out the side they are responsible for. This vertical stacking of ideologies would undoubtedly lead to a sense of hierarchy which could be managed according to the weight of each vote. The most popular party could reserve their spot at the top, while the other parties would still be present. In that way, the output would not be about the ruling government, but about every voice in parliament in a democratic manner. Regardless, this race is unstoppable as each city already proved their presence, so the time has come to the fun part, to perform it in the form of cadavre-exquis. At the end of the day, the absurdist politics needs to reconnect to their good old Surrealist brothers.

The pre-conceptions of a conservative society regarding how a sculpture should look are mostly based on symbolising heroism, unless one wants to alter their point of view and perceive these sculptures as contributors to nationalistic and heroic fetish. Dinosaurs, the earliest owners of the lands we are stepping on and defending right now, how much more nationalist and nostalgic can it get? </p>
